4/11/2012


General Info:
	There are four classes: A driver class, A producer Class(thread), A consumer Class(thread), and a buffer class. 	
	use "make all" to make all to get .class files. To run the driver type "java main". make clean removes all .class files.

Class info: 
	main: creates threads and waits for them to finish once done it prints closing messages and exits.
	buffer: a circular buffer with a capacity of 1000 items. It also manages critical sections between the two threads.
	Consumer: thread thats in charge of consuming from the buffer it consumes 1000000 times
	Producer: thread in charge of producing randomn doubles and throws them into the buffer.
*note* for in deal description look at code.
